# OndertekenenDemo
Demo implementation for the Ondertekenen.nl REST interface.
Signhost.com is a service that makes it possible to digitally sign, seal or deliver
your documents. (http://www.signhost.com) Documents can be signed directly from your
webportal or by sending a signing request by email or other message to the end-user.

In some countries signhost is branded by a locale domain, like ondertekenen.nl in
The Netherlands. In this document the signhost.com domain is replaceable by the
local promoted domains like ondertekenen.nl.

During the signing process of the end-user, different identity verification methods
can be used to include in the digital signature ie; email, SMS, scribble signature
or authentication mechanisms like Google, LinkedIn, and national eID like DigiD(NL)
or eHerkenning(NL).
